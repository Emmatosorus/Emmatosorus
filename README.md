    A small raycasting project written in **C**. Run a map or create your own and navigate a walled off map.

  - **[So_long](https://github.com/Emmatosorus/so_long)** 🎮
    
    A small and chill 2D game written in **C**. It’s a simple game where you navigate and collect items, all in a style inspired by tunic! 

  - **[IRC](https://github.com/Emmatosorus/IRC)** 💬
    
    An **IRC server** but also an **AI bot** connected to the chatGPT API. And a small bot for managing a dictionary of forbidden words that channel operators can add or remove from.
    The bot will alert operators when a forbidden word is detected in chat!
