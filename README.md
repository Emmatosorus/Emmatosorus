    A small shell, written in **C**. Inspired by bash, you can use pipes, and/or, redirections, parentheses, heredocs and here strings to navigate your terminal.
    Includes : cd, echo, export, unset, pwd, env and exit.

  - 🧊 **Cube3D**
    A small raycasting project written in **C**. Run a map or create your own and navigate a walled off map.
    Inspired by wolfenstein but without the gameplay 😉

→ **Pinned Projects**  
  - 🎮 **[So_long](https://github.com/Emmatosorus/so_long)**  
    A small and chill 2D game written in **C**. It’s a simple game where you navigate and collect items, all in a style inspired by tunic! 

  - 💬 **[IRC](https://github.com/Emmatosorus/IRC)**  
    An **IRC server** but also an **AI bot** connected to the chatGPT API. And a small bot for managing a dictionary of forbidden words that channel operators can add or remove from.
    The bot will alert operators when a forbidden word is detected in chat!
